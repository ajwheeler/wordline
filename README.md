`wl` is a simple utility for building and searching a plain-text timeline (`$WORDLINE_FILE`).  I use it to keep track of dates.

```
> wl --help
Manipulate the worldline

Usage: wl <COMMAND>

Commands:
  add    Add a new event with date and description
  show   Show events. No args = show all. One date = show that date/month/year. Two dates = show range
  query  Search for events containing text (case-insensitive)
  help   Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

Options:
  -h, --help     Print help
  -V, --version  Print version
```
